### inspections---

length(weight_g)
str(weight_g)

### change vector ---
weight_g<-c(weight_g,90)

### challenge---
num_char<-c(1,2,3,"a") # choses lowest common denominator, avector have to choose the same class of function---

num_logical<-c(1,2,3,TRUE)
char_logical<-c("a","b","c",TRUE)

##subsetting--
